in data. Especially valuable in areas rich with recorded information, analytics relies 
on the simultaneous application of statistics, computer programming and operations research 
to quantify performance.

performance. Specifically, areas within analytics include predictive analytics, prescriptive 
analytics, enterprise decision management, descriptive analytics, cognitive analytics, Big 
Data Analytics, retail analytics, store assortment and stock-keeping unit optimization, 
marketing optimization and marketing mix modeling, web analytics, call analytics, speech 
analytics, sales force sizing and optimization, price and promotion modeling, predictive

computation (see big data), the algorithms and software used for analytics harness the most 
current methods in computer science, statistics, and mathematics.

The field of data analysis. Analytics often involves studying past historical data to
